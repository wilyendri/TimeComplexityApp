# TimeComplexityApp
Java educational application which helps to better understand the differences between different sorting and search algorithms in terms of time complexity
The app aloows users to select a range that will determine the number of random elements the array will be filled up
with. Each button will sort the array and calculate the time the specified sorting algorithm took.
 TODO: Add Save option which will write to a text file and save the file
 TODO: Add Open option that allows user to open file and output sorting functions and saved files
 TODO: Add Data Base to output table of different algorithm and their time complexity
 TODO: Add multithreading so multiple users can play the app
 TODO: Add other Algorithms such as Binary Search
